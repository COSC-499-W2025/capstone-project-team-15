## Personal log of Luis Wen (from Week 3)

## What went well

- The team discussion went smoothly, and we were able to share and compare requirements with other teams.
- After the discussion, our team made some adjustments to our requirements

## What didnâ€™t go well

- Teams did not have a designated section to meet, which wasted around 5 minutes or more while trying to find each other.  
- The requirements for the teams I spoke with (Teams 13, 14, and 16) were similar to the ones we already had printed.

## Planning for the next cycle

- Create and submit our system architecture.  
- Prepare and submit our project proposal.  
- Ensure weekly logs (both individual and team) are consistently completed and merged in the repository.
