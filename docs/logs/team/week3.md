# Team Log (September 15 - 21, 2025)

## Attendees
- Rylan Millar
- Alex Batke
- Cole Powrie
- Liam Storgaard
- Will Tilden
- Luis Wen

## What went well
- Team discussions were productive, and everyone contributed ideas about the requirements, and language for the project
- We discuseed our understanding of the project goals and confirmed that our requirements matched well with what other teams had

## What didnâ€™t go well
- There was no designated meeting spot causing delays, chaos, and confusion
- Comparing requirements with other teams (Teams 13, 14, and 16) showed that many groups had nearly identical requirements, which limited opportunities for new insights

## Planning for the next cycle
- Develop the system architecture as a team to establish the foundation for design and implementation
- Draft and submit the project proposal by the upcoming deadline in week 4
- Maintain consistency by recording weekly logs (individual and team) in the repository to support reflection and tracking of progress
- Keep communicating with each other openly and frequently
