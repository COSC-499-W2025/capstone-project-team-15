# Personal Log of Alex Batke (Week 3)

## WHat went well 

- Inital discussion between team members about general project guidelines and requirements were effective. Tean consenus was reached on multiple different points
- making small, sensible refinements to our team's list of requirements after the inter-team discussion of the project requirements 

## WHat didn't go well
- requirements from some teams were not measurable, making it difficult to understamd their thought process and what they deemed neccessary
- other requirements from some teams were also non specific (eg. the system should search the user's folder structure)

## Planning for the next cycle
- Deciding roles for team members
- Start more specific, in depth planning for the project
- fine tune requirements as necessary as planning continues
