# Personal log of Liam Storgaard (from Week 3)

## What went well

- Team seems to work well together so far.
- We got some perspective on the merits of a desktop vs. web based app for the project

## What didnâ€™t go well

- Requirements from other teams were basically identical to our own so not much was learned beyond what was stated above.

## Planning for the next cycle

- Further refine the planned structure of our app
- Decide who will be doing what on the project more concretely.
- Refine requirements as needed.
