    These features, the proposal and system architecture diagram, were recorded as issues in our github repository and have all team members listed on them as assignees.

    This week we completed both the project proposal and the system architecture diagram and next week we will move on to the data flow diagram.

    Another good week with a good team! Looking forward to working with this team throughout the year.




# Personal log of Will Tilden (from Week 3)

## What went well

- Team seems to work well together so far similar mindset and determination to do well on the project
- We got along well not just as like a team but we can have fun together which I think is important for a long term project like this one

## What didnâ€™t go well

- The requirements gathering activity, while I believe I understand the intetion behind it, didn't feel terribly useful just given that a lot of the time was spent repeating requirements back at each other that teams already had themselves, I think I would have preffered having requirements given to us and just getting on writing the code sooner personally

## Planning for the next cycle

- Clarify and solidify requirements to the point that they are ready to inform coding / building decisions
- Delegate roles and responsibilities as far as who should work on which part(s) of the app
- Develop a sprint structure and cycle of some kind to keep the team synchronized and organized in moving forward with the project at the right pace and in an organized fashion
