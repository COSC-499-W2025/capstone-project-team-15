#Personal Log for Rylan Millar (33334400) Week 3 September 15-21

## What went well
- Our team is already working together effectively and our team gets along well
- Our team was able to identify what we needed to do for this project and what we could all individually contribute to the project.

## What didn't go well
- We created a team name before we found out we were supposed to name ourselves after our team number on Canvas, which led to a multitude of problems.
- We needed to collaborate with other groups and some of the people in our class are incompetent.

## Planning for the next cycle
- Ensure this week runs a lot smoother than last week
- Begin the planning of our project more in depth
